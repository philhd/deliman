This is a ridiculous game that was generated almost entirely by the o1 model in 7 iterations for fun.

index1-x.html represents the game through each iteration.

I had to manually intervene at the end because it broke one of the sprite svgs and couldn't fix it. All I did was replace the sprite with one of the earlier ones.

Here are the prompts used to generate it:

1. Create a platformer game in html css and javascript where you play as a deli manager and fight off angry customers by hurling deli meats at them. It is set in a supermarket. Customers can roll shopping carts at you.
2. Can you make it so that the deli meats follow a natural arc like it would with normal gravity? Can you also make the deli meat look more like deli meat, and make it rotate as it flies through the air? Also, the deli manager should not jump when he throws a meat. Remember to make the customers push shopping carts at the deli manager.
3. create a deli meat and shopping cart sprite for me
4. Can you change the color of the deli meat sprite to be balogna colored, and make the shopping cart sprite a bit larger? Can you Also create a sprite for the deli manager and the angry customers to make them look more realistic?
5. That is giving me a index4.html:134 Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'DeliManager' before initialization. Can you figure out what the bug is and fix it?
6. The hit boxes for the deli manager and the angry customers are bigger than the sprites now that they are not just rectangles. Can you fix the hit boxes so they only extend to the edge of the visible sprites?
7. The deli manager sprite is giving this error: Failed to load resource: net::ERR_INVALID_URL Can you identify the bug and fix it?
